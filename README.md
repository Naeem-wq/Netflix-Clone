## Features:

In this app you'll find your typical netflix features, such as:

* A Login page
* A "Who's Watching" page, where you can select your different profiles based on who's currently watching.
* A netflix landing page where all movies are displayed.
* There's a searchbar, where you can search for movies based on their title.
* Each movie has an ADD button so that you can add those movies to your watch list.
* There's your watch list page as mentioned above, to display those movies you added.
* All this is possible due to the app also coming with Local Storage to save all those data.
 


## Features to come:

This app is still under development so there's still a few things that needs to be added.
Some now and some things in the near future. These things include:

* Some Animations
* Media Queries
* Adding the actual video links to each movie object so that you can actually watch some movies on the app.
* Adding PHP and MySQL to the site to store and recognise user login details and also to store data on the server side.
